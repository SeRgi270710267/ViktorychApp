# Status snapshot

Written 2026-10-30, about 10:00 CET (09:00 UTC). Main was at `a70f29f8` and the latest D1 migration was `0102_regone_social.sql`. This is a snapshot: check `gh pr list` and `git log origin/main` before acting on it, and update this file in a small PR after a big session.

## Live on main (recent)

- Usage panel in Settings never sticks on "Loading" (#456).
- Profile Games tab: ReGone link/unlink, stats and rooms live in an X-style Games tab instead of the profile header (#457).
- Delete all data on this device, local data encrypted at rest, inactivity expiry (#395).
- Tab shortcut menus (#394), full-screen X-style video viewer (#405), X mobile timeline layout (#358), low-usage playbook (#373).
- Feeds add box keeps text and focus across redraws (#455).
- NZlay Forums as an X-style community with on-device login and ReGone links (#452; switches `nzlay_forum`, `nzlay_forum_post`, `nzlay_forum_regone`). Live posting has not been verified with a real NZlay account.
- Following and Followers lists of external accounts, browsable in full (#451).
- Connected keys: your own spare Discord key kept only on the device (#447), a page per service with the stepped "Get your key" guide (#448), and sending messages you type yourself (#449). Old server-side-key Discord servers stay read-only.
- ReGone social features (#431), TV sign-in with the phone, TV app with controller play (see `docs/TV*.md`).

## Open pull requests

| PR | State | What it needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #459 Desktop right column: unified Who to follow + People you may know; collapsed Friends shows who is online | In progress, DIRTY | Merge main, fix the stamp, green CI, then merge. |
| #458 For you: community posts from Reddit, forums and NZlay; titles on their own line; joined row fix | In progress, DIRTY | Finish the Communities rows (below), merge main, green CI. |
| #413 Gift NFTs (off by default) | DIRTY, old base | Owner decision (wallet/minting). Ships switched off. |
| #409 Link cards with inline official video players | DIRTY, old base | Merge main, fix the failing check. |
| #406 Dependabot npm group (wrangler, miniflare; dev tools) | CLEAN, green | Owner approval (dependency change). Low risk. |
| #376 Dependabot actions group (major bumps across about 30 workflows) | CLEAN, green | Owner approval (workflow change). Medium risk: artifact upload/download formats changed. |
| #367 Nearby chat (Bitchat) web fallback | DIRTY | Merge main, fix the failing check. |
| #365 Gifts and store with a payment adapter | DIRTY | Payment keys and owner decision; ships switched off; migration `0090_store.sql` must be renumbered above the latest. |
| #359 Newsletters as posts | BLOCKED, old base | Merge main, re-run checks. |
| #357 X video always in our own player | DIRTY | Merge main, fix the failing check. |
| #355 Messages servers phase 3 (voice, video, screen share) | DIRTY, 1 failing check | Renumber migrations 0082–0084 above the latest, merge main. |
| #352 Messages servers phase 2 (threads, forums, events, polls) | DIRTY, 2 failing checks | Renumber migration 0083, merge main. Ship before #355. |
| #274 Emoji status badges and store | DIRTY, very old | Rebuild on current main (presence privacy changed); migration 0040 collides. |
| #269 Collapse the home composer | DIRTY, very old | Overlaps the shipped composer collapse; rebuild or close (owner). |
| #145 Lives and new posts on a Worker schedule | DIRTY, very old | Recommend closing: main already runs a per-minute Worker cron; it also edits workflows and `wrangler.toml`. Owner decides. |

## Needs the owner

- Approve or decline Dependabot #406 (npm) and #376 (GitHub Actions).
- Close or keep #145 (obsolete; edits workflows).
- Payments: #365 and #413 stay switched off until payment keys are added and you decide.
- Migration renumbering for #365, #352, #355, #274 before they can merge.
- Keys still needed (set as Worker or GitHub secrets from the exact steps in each doc):
  - SMSPool (`SMSPOOL_API_KEY`, Inbox › SMS codes, `docs/sms-codes.md`).
  - IMAP mail relay (Inbox mail, `docs/INBOX-MAIL.md`).
  - SimpleLogin (email aliases).
  - YouTube API key (steps still to be written for you).
- Optional: Telegram alerts (`OWNER_ALERT_CHAT_ID`), TURN for Go live, Turnstile, the short TV address (`docs/HANDOFF.md`).
- A real-TV test of controller play in ReGone (`docs/TV-CONTROLLER.md`) and real-iPhone checks.
- Optional third origin on Deno Deploy (free) next to the Worker and Render; not set up.

## In progress

1. **Sign-up fix (top priority).** The Temporary account screen fails with "Something went wrong" and its title is not translated. Branch `fix/signup-temp-account`, no PR yet. Every sign-up path must work end to end on the live site (temporary account, username and number, passkey), and every title must be in en, es, ru and hi.
2. **Usage loading.** Fixed in #456; confirm on the live owner account that the panel loads.
3. **Profile Games tab.** Shipped in #457; owner wants before/after screenshots.
4. **For you and Communities (#458).**
   - Community posts from Reddit, forums and NZlay show in For you.
   - Forum posts show the title on its own bold line above the body, X style.
   - The Communities row on Home (Inicio) shows only communities the person joined, and all of them (Reddit sources they follow, NZlay once joined). It can be organized into folders: a folder is one tile the same size as a community tile, showing a small grid of its communities' pictures; tap opens it; create, rename, reorder, move communities between folders; folders are private to each person.
   - A new row in Explore (Explorar) shows all communities. The owner can pin featured communities, which appear first; only the owner can pin, reorder or unpin.
5. **Desktop right panel (#459).** "People you may know" merges permanently with "Who to follow" into one detailed panel (picture, name, short bio, why suggested, Follow, dismiss). The Friends panel shows green online dots and a count even when collapsed. Phones unchanged.
6. **Old PR queue.** Bring every open PR above to green and merge one at a time, except the owner items.
