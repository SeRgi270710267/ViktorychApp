# Third-party art

## Gift art (Gifts page, `shared/gift-catalog.js`)

Most gifts use original illustrations made for this project in
`icons/gifts/<gift id>.webp` (256 px WebP, listed in `LOCAL_ART` in
`shared/gift-catalog.js`). They were generated with an image model, have no
third-party license or attribution requirement, and copy no VK artwork, logos
or trademarks.

Gifts without an illustration yet draw from Google's Noto Emoji. Those images
are hotlinked, not copied into this repository, and are shown unmodified.
Nothing on the Gifts page reuses VK's gift artwork.

If an image fails to load, the page falls back from the illustration or the
animated emoji to the static Noto PNG, then
to the device's own emoji character.

The page footer carries a short attribution line, and this file holds the full
notice.

## Wordmark font (personal sidebar logo text, `fonts/`)

Custom sidebar logo text is set in Inter, the same font the ViktorychApp
wordmark is drawn from. `fonts/inter-400.woff2` and `fonts/inter-900.woff2`
are subsets (Latin, Latin Extended, Cyrillic, Greek, Vietnamese) of Inter 4.1
Regular and Black from https://github.com/rsms/inter, made with fontTools
`pyftsubset`. Inter is licensed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1,
